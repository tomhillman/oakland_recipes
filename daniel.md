serves 4 to 6

Ingredients
2 tablespoons (1 1/2 sticks)/170 grams unsalted butter ½ cup/120 ml maple syrup 2 ¼ cups/530 ml buttermilk 3 large eggs 1 ½ cups/180 grams yellow cornmeal, fine or medium-coarse grind ½ cup/65 grams whole wheat flour ½ cup/60 grams all-purpose flour 1 ½ tablespoons/18 grams baking powder 1 ½ teaspoons/9 grams kosher salt ½ teaspoon/5 grams baking soda

## Preparation

### Step 1
Heat oven to 375 degrees. On the stovetop, in a 11- or 12-inch skillet (ovenproof and preferably cast iron), melt the butter over medium heat. Cook, swirling pan to lightly coat sides and bottom, until the foam subsides and the butter turns a deep nut brown. (Watch carefully to see that it does not burn.)

### Step 2
Pour brown butter into a large bowl. (Do not wipe out the pan.) Whisk the maple syrup into the butter, then whisk in buttermilk. The mixture should be cool to the touch; if not, let cool before whisking in the eggs. Then whisk in the cornmeal, flours, baking powder, salt and baking soda.

### Step 3 
If the skillet is no longer hot (cast iron retains heat longer than other metals), reheat it briefly on the stove for a few minutes. Scrape batter back into it. Bake until the top is golden brown and a toothpick inserted into it emerges clean, 30 to 40 minutes. Cool in the skillet for 10 minutes before slicing.
